1
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,233
At the left we can see...

2
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,280
At the right we can see the...

3
00:00:19,315 --> 00:00:21,085
...the head-snarlers

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,395
Everything is safe.
Perfectly safe.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,955
Emo?

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,798
Watch out!

7
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,559
Are you hurt?

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,797
I don't think so.
You?

9
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,712
I'm Ok.

10
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,674
Get up.
Emo, it's not safe here.

11
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,038
Let's go.

12
00:01:01,073 --> 00:01:02,517
What's next?

13
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,388
You'll see!

14
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,997
(howling wind)

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,911
Emo.
This way.

16
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,674
Follow me!

17
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,873
(buzzing wires and chattery conversations)

18
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,199
Hurry Emo!

19
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,035
(louder telephone voices)

20
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,275
(phone ringing)

21
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,157
You're not paying attention!

22
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,114
I just want to answer the...
...phone.

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,878
Emo, look,
I mean listen.

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,753
You have to learn to listen.

25
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,592
This is not some game.

26
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,798
You, I mean we,
we could easily die out here.

27
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,228
Listen,
listen to the sounds of the machine.

28
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,037
Listen to your breathing.

29
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,597
(Buzzing wires)

30
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,797
(laughing)

31
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,157
(oriental dance music)

32
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,237
Well, don't you ever get tired of this?

33
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,112
Tired?!?

34
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,551
Emo, the machine is like clockwork.

35
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,031
One move out of place...

36
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,997
...and you're ground to a pulp.

37
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,765
But isn't it -

38
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,634
Pulp, Emo!
Is that what you want, pulp?

39
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,477
Emo, your goal in life...

40
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,317
...pulp?

41
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,035
(loud metal sounds)

42
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,357
Emo, close your eyes.

43
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,237
Why?
- Now!

44
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,070
Ok.

45
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,553
Good.

46
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,672
What do you see at your left side, Emo?

47
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,317
Nothing.
- Really?

48
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,475
No, nothing at all.

49
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,159
And at your right,
what do you see at your right side, Emo?

50
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,113
The same Proog, exactly the same...

51
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,990
...nothing!
- Great.

52
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,677
(sound of camera flash)

53
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,077
(engine drone)

54
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,674
Listen Proog! Do you hear that!
(amusement park music)

55
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,758
Can we go here?

56
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,638
There?
It isn't safe, Emo.

57
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,593
But...
- Trust me, it's not.

58
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,640
Maybe I could...

59
00:06:37,675 --> 00:06:39,392
No.

60
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,199
NO!

61
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,198
Any further questions, Emo?

62
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,149
No.

63
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,949
Emo?

64
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,800
Emo, why...

65
00:06:55,835 --> 00:06:56,725
Emo...

66
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,548
...why can't you see
the beauty of this place?

67
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,511
The way it works.

68
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,205
How perfect it is.

69
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,152
No, Proog, I don't see.

70
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,038
I don't see because there's nothing there.

71
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,834
And why should I trust my
life to something that isn't there?

72
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,717
Well can you tell me that?

73
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,637
Answer me!

74
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,509
Proog...

75
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,375
...you're a sick man!

76
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,231
Stay away from me!

77
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,959
No! Emo! It's a trap!

78
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,925
Hah, it's a trap.

79
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,873
At the left side you can see
the hanging gardens of Babylon!

80
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,671
How's that for a trap?

81
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,517
No, Emo.

82
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,478
At the right side you can see...
...well guess what...

83
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,952
...the colossus of Rhodes!

84
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,285
No!

85
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,917
The colossus of Rhodes
and it is here just for you Proog.

86
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,685
It is there...

87
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,678
I'm telling you,
Emo...

88
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,353
...it is.

89
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,555
(howling wind)
